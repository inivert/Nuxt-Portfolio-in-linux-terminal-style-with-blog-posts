This post shows you how to add images to your blog posts.

## Single Image Example

Here's how to add a basic image:

![Linux Terminal](/images/blog/terminal.jpeg)

Just copy this format and change:

1. The text in brackets [ ] is the image description
2. The path in parentheses ( ) is where your image is stored

## Image with Text

You can add text before and after images:

Some text before the image...

## <!--* This is how you add  spacers --->

![Security Dashboard](/images/blog/imagesample.jpeg)

And text after the image.

## Tips

- Put your images in the public/images/blog folder
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Make sure the image path is correct
  
That's all you need to know about adding images!
